# Fast-3D-Facial-Curves
The codes are based on the following paper.  

M. Samad and K. Iftekharuddin, Frenet frame-based generalized space curve  representation for pose invariant 
classification and recognition of 3D Face. IEEE Transactions on  Human-Machine Systems (THMS), 
vol. 46, no. 4, pp. 522 - 533, 2016.  

The code repository includes the following functions  

1. Extraction of any arbitrary number of radial curves 
(from 0 to 360 degrees starting from the nosetip location)  

2. Extraction of iso-geodesic curves at arbitrary level-sets.  
3. Extraction of Frenet frame-based 3D orthogonal coordinates at each point of the extracted curves.  
4. Extraction of novel geometric features derived from Frenet frames, which allow discriminative 
facial analysis such as 3D face recognition, facial expression recognition. The extracted features can 
be subjected to machine learning pipeline for discriminative analysis like 3D face recognition, 
facial expression recognition and so on. 

The features were tested on three publicly available datasets  

1. BU-3DFE dataset  
2. Bosphorous dataset  
3. FRGC v2.0 dataset  

Please read the paper, run the demo, and contact if you have any question.
